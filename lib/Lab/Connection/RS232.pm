# Initialization is handled by default by the bus (see e.g. Bus::RS232).
# In some cases when this is not possible it can be done by a derived connection class.

=head1 NAME

Lab::Connection::RS232 - RS232 Connection base class (deprecated)

=head1 VERSION

version 3.899

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is the base class for all connections providing a RS232 interface.
Every inheriting class constructor should start as follows:

	sub new {
		my $proto = shift;
		my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;
		my $self = $class->SUPER::new(@_);
		$self->_construct(__PACKAGE__); #initialize fields etc.
		...
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module belongs to a deprecated legacy module stack, frozen and not under development anymore. Please port your code to the new API; its documentation can be found on the Lab::Measurement homepage, L<https://www.labmeasurement.de/>.

C<Lab::Connection::RS232> is the base class for all connections providing a GPIB interface. 
It is not usable on its own. It inherits from L<Lab::Connection>.

=head1 NAME

Lab::Connection::RS232 - RS232 connection base class

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

Generally called in child class constructor:

 my $self = $class->SUPER::new(@_);

Return blessed $self, with @_ accessible through $self->Config().

=head1 METHODS

This just calls back on the methods inherited from Lab::Connection.

If you inherit this class in your own connection however, you have to provide the following methods.
Take a look at e.g. L<Lab::Connection::VISA_RS232> and at the basic implementations 
in L<Lab::Connection> (they may even suffice).

=head3 Write()

Takes a config hash, has to at least pass the key 'command' correctly to the underlying bus.

=head3 Read()

Takes a config hash, reads back a message from the device.

=head3 Clear()

Clears the instrument.

=head2 config

Provides unified access to the fields in initial @_ to all the child classes.
E.g.

=head1 CAVEATS/BUGS

Probably few. Mostly because there's not a lot to be done here. Please report.
