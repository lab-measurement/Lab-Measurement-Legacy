=head1 NAME

Lab::Connection::VISA - VISA-type connection

=head1 VERSION

version 3.899

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Ths general VISA Connection class for Lab::Bus::VISA digests VISA resource names.

This is not called directly. To make a VISA suppporting instrument use Lab::Connection::VISA, set
the connection_type parameter accordingly:

$instrument = new HP34401A(
   connection_type => 'VISA',
   resource_name => 'GPIB0::14::INSTR',
)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Lab::Connection::VISA> provides a VISA-type connection with L<Lab::Bus::VISA> using 
NI VISA (L<Lab::VISA>) as backend.

It inherits from L<Lab::Connection>.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

 my $connection = new Lab::Connection::VISA(
   connection_type => 'VISA',
   resource_name => 'GPIB0::14::INSTR',
 }

=head1 METHODS

This just falls back on the methods inherited from L<Lab::Connection>.

=head2 config

Provides unified access to the fields in initial @_ to all the child classes.
E.g.

 $GPIB_Address=$instrument->Config(gpib_address);

Without arguments, returns a reference to the complete $self->Config aka @_ of the constructor.

 $Config = $connection->Config();
 $GPIB_Address = $connection->Config()->{'gpib_address'};

=head1 CAVEATS/BUGS

Probably few. Mostly because there's not a lot to be done here. Please report.
