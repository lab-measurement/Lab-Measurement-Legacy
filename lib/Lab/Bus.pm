=head1 NAME

Lab::Bus - Bus base class

=head1 VERSION

version 3.899

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a base class for inheriting bus types.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module belongs to a deprecated legacy module stack, frozen and not under development anymore. Please port your code to the new API; its documentation can be found on the Lab::Measurement homepage, L<https://www.labmeasurement.de/>.

C<Lab::Bus> is a base class for individual buses. It does not do anything on its
own. For more detailed information on the use of bus objects, take a look on a
child class, e.g. L<Lab::Bus::LinuxGPIB>.

C<Lab::Bus::BusList> contains a hash with references to all the active buses in
your program. They are put there by the constructor of the individual bus
C<Lab::Bus::new()> and have two levels: Package name and a unique bus ID (GPIB
board index offers itself for GPIB). This is to transparently (to the use
interface) reuse bus objects, as there may only be one bus object for every
(hardware) bus. weaken() is used on every reference stored in this hash, so
it doesn't prevent object destruction when the last "real" reference is lost.
Yes, this breaks object orientation a little, but it comes so handy!

  our %Lab::Bus::BusList = [
	$Package => {
		$UniqueID => $Object,
	}
	'Lab::Bus::GPIB' => {
		'0' => $Object,		"0" is the gpib board index
	}

Place your twin searching code in C<$self->_search_twin()>. Make sure it
evaluates C<$self->IgnoreTwin()>. Look at L<Lab::Bus::LinuxGPIB>.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

Generally called in child class constructor:

 my $self = $class->SUPER::new(@_);

Return blessed $self, with @_ accessible through $self->Config().

=head1 METHODS

=head2 config

Provides unified access to the fields in initial @_ to all the child classes.

=head2 connection_new

Empty stub function for overloading

=head2 connection_read

Empty stub function for overloading

=head2 connection_write

Empty stub function for overloading

=head1 CAVEATS/BUGS

Probably few. Mostly because there's not so much done here.
