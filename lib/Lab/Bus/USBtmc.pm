#  
# please note: with the usbtmc kernel module on Linux
# kernel 4.7.4 (and some prior versions) the module has a
# built-in unchangable timeout of 5 seconds. So the only
# way to deal with timeouts is "try the read N times, and see
# if there is a response".  It also makes no sense to "sleep between
# the write and read" of a query, since one might as well do
# the read and get a (potentially) faster result.

# So:
# wait_query is ignored
# brutal only has the effect of not throwing errors on read timeouts
# timeout is rounded to 5 second interval, to give the number of reads
# that are tried

# kernel <4.20 the default buffer size was 2048; later
# kernel versions have a default buffer size of 4096, but
# for some reason, tests with a TDS2024B show that the
# buffering is 1024. It might be at the 'device' end. 

# the reason this matters is in how one determines that a usbtmc
# 'read' is complete, because many of the queries do not return
# a completely deterministic number of bytes; so you have to request
# with a larger number, and you get less. Is that because the read
# is split up in multiple buffers (with more remaining to be read),
# or did you reach the end? Reading data that isn't there will give
# a timeout error, or hang the interface.

# there are four hints for 'reached the end':
#   the bytes returned is less than a full buffer
#   the last byte of the returned buffer is '\n' (LF)
#   the EOM bit is set in bmTransferAttributes (bit 0) (4.20+ only)
#   the device has MAV bit set in STB when 'more data available'. 
#

# the STB can be read by ioctl USBTMC488_IOCTL_READ_STB  (>=4.6)
# but it's only really useful if there is a USB 'interrupt'
# endpoint for retrieving STB in a side-channel from the main
# BULK-in data channel, otherwise it just gets queued to the end
# of the other data. (>=4.6 has this)

# all of this stuff is relevant when binary data is read from the
# device, because you can't really trust that a \n at the end of
# a block of data means that it's the end, or just an unfortunate
# coincidence.

# the EOM bit is faster to deal with, no extra USB i/o is
# requred, but it does need the requested buffer to be >=
# the internal buffer, to make sure that that one is getting
# the full buffer for which the EOM bit applies (instead of the
# first part of a buffer that is being transfered to user in
# smaller parts).

# so, going to ignore the user read_length for performing
# the usb i/o, and only apply it when deciding what to
# store for transfer to user. 

# going with the ioctl "*STB?" version for now, since it
# seems more likely to work without weird failure modes.

=head1 NAME

Lab::Bus::USBtmc - USBtmc (Test & Measurement) Linux kernel driver bus

=head1 VERSION

version 3.899

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is the USB TMC (Test & Measurement Class) bus class.

  my $tmc = new Lab::Bus::USBtmc({ });

or implicit through instrument and connection creation:

  my $instrument = new Lab::Instrument::HP34401A({
    connection_type => 'USBtmc',
    tmc_address=>1,
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module belongs to a deprecated legacy module stack, frozen and not under development anymore. Please port your code to the new API; its documentation can be found on the Lab::Measurement homepage, L<https://www.labmeasurement.de/>.

Driver for the interface provided by the usbtmc linux kernel module.

Obviously, this will work for Linux systems only. 
On Windows, please use L<Lab::Bus::VISA>. The interfaces are (errr, will be) identical.

Note: you don't need to explicitly handle bus objects. The Instruments will create them themselves, and existing bus will
be automagically reused.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

 my $bus = Lab::Bus::USBtmc({
  });

Return blessed $self, with @_ accessible through $self->config().

=head1 Thrown Exceptions

Lab::Bus::USBtmc throws

  Lab::Exception::TMCOpenFileError
  
  Lab::Exception::CorruptParameter

  Lab::Exception::DriverError

  Lab::Exception::Timeout

=head1 METHODS

=head2 connection_new

  $tmc->connection_new({ tmc_address => $addr });

Creates a new connection ("instrument handle") for this bus. The argument is a hash, whose contents 
depend on the bus type.

For TMC there are several ways to indicate which device is to be used 

if more than one is given, it is the first one that is used:
tmc_address => $addr         selects /dev/usbtmc$addr 
visa_name=> 'USB::0xVVVV::0xPPPP::SSSSSS::INSTR';
    where VVVV is the hex usb vendor number, PPPP is the hex usb product number, and SSSSSS is the serial
    number string.  If SSSSSS is '*', then the first device found that matches vendor and product will be
    used.
usb_vendor=>'0xVVVV' or 0xVVVV    vendor number
usb_product=>'0xPPPP' or 0xPPPP   product number
usb_serial=>'SSSSSS'  or '*'      serial number, or wildcard.

The usb_serial defaults to '*' if not specified. 

The handle is usually stored in an instrument object and given to connection_read, connection_write etc.
to identify and handle the calling instrument:

  $InstrumentHandle = $tmc->connection_new({ usb_vendor => 0x0699, usb_product => 0x1234 });
  $result = $tmc->connection_read($self->InstrumentHandle(), { options });

Please note that, because of obscure Linux device configuration issues,
it is sometimes difficult to extract the USBtmc device serial number
without 'root' privileges. This code tries several techniques, including
invoking 'lsusb', looking in /proc/bus/usb, and looking in 
/sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices. There is no guarantee that those hacking
on the Linux kernel won't change these in future. 

Also the current (as of kernel 4.7.4, and many earlier versions) default
kernel modules for usbtmc has a 'built in' read timeout hardcoded to 
5 seconds. The read/timeout code here works with this. 

Some years ago, when the USBtmc module was first being added to standard
distributions, it was "edited to conform with kernel module style guidelines"
which resulted in a completely nonfunctional driver.  Alternate (older)
versions from device manufacturers DID work, and had greater functionality.
If you are using one of those modules, check to see if the timeout logic
here requires modification.  

Unfortunately, it's not so easy for a little perl module to tell what
variety of kernel module is being used, so that will be up to the user. 

See C<Lab::Instrument::Read()>.

=head2 connection_write

  $tmc->connection_write( $InstrumentHandle, { command => $Command } );

Sends $Command to the instrument specified by the handle.

=head2 connection_read

  $tmc->connection_read( $InstrumentHandle, { read_length => $readlength } );

Reads back a maximum of $readlength bytes.  If $readlength <= 0 (which is the default)
there is no limit.

Setting C<Brutal> to a true value will result in timeouts being ignored, and the gathered data returned without error.

IF there is a timeout (i.e., no data) then connection_read returns a zero
length string.

=head2 timeout

  $tmc->timeout( $connection_handle, $timeout );

Sets the timeout in seconds for tmc operations on the device/connection specified by $connection_handle.  $timeout <= 0 means "no timeout, indefinate wait".

The timeout is quantized in units of the kernel module timeout (currently
5 sec in kernel 4.7.4), so the timeout just results in determining the
number of reads that are attempted before a timeout error is thrown. 

=head2 config

Provides unified access to the fields in initial @_ to all the child classes.
E.g.

 $tmc_serial = $instrument->config(usb_serial);

Without arguments, returns a reference to the complete $self->config aka @_ of the constructor.

 $config = $bus->config();
 $tmc_serial = $bus->config()->{'usb_serial'};

=head2 get_stb

    $statusbyte = $tmc->get_stb($connection_handle, [$stbmask]);

reads the STB register, using ioctl/USB interrupt endpoint, so it does not disturb the
command/data queues.  If a stbmask is provided, it is "anded" with the status byte
and returns 'true' if any bits are set.  $stbmask = 0x10 is the MAV bit for
'more data available'.

=head1 CAVEATS/BUGS

Lots, I'm sure.
